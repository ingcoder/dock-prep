## Quick Start

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n docking python=3.10 -y && activate docking

# Install dependencies and dock-prep
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pdbfixer openmm biopython openbabel pdb2pqr -y
git clone https://github.com/ingcoder/dock-prep.git
pip install -e dock-prep

# Install external tools

## Installation

### 1. Set up Python Environment
```bash
conda create -n docking-pipeline python=3.10 -y
conda activate docking-pipeline
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pdbfixer openmm biopython openbabel pdb2pqr -y
```

### 2. Install dock-prep 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ingcoder/dock-prep.git
pip install -e dock-prep 
```

### 3. Install Required Tools
```bash
# Install MGLTools
cd dock-prep/scripts
chmod +x install_mgltools.sh  # Ensure script has executable permissions
./install_mgltools.sh

# Install MolProbity
chmod +x install_molprobity.sh  # Ensure script has executable permissions
./install_molprobity.sh
```

> **Important Note**: If you encounter "permission denied" errors when running the scripts, you need to manually set executable permissions using the `chmod +x script_name.sh` command. The scripts include self-fixing permission code, but this only works if the script can be executed in the first place.

### 4. Verify Installation
After installation, you can verify that all dependencies are properly installed:
```bash
# Run the dependency checker
dock-prep-check
```

This will check that:
- All required Python packages are installed
- You're running in a conda environment
- External tools (OpenBabel, PDB2PQR) are on your PATH
- Configuration-based tools (MGLTools, MolProbity) are properly configured

## Usage (Linux or MacOS)

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dock-prep/                      # Dock-Prep repo or package
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1abc.pdb                        # raw input structure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1abc_structure_docking.pdbqt
```


### Basic Commands

Run the converter with a PDB ID or file:
```bash
# Process entire protein (default behavior, works for small proteins)
dock-prep --file_input path/to/1abc.pdb --verbose

# Process specific chains
dock-prep --file_input path/to/1abc.pdb --include_chains A,B --verbose

# Extract chains by distance from a reference peptide chain in angstrom (5 Angstrom by default)
dock-prep --file_input path/to/1abc.pdb reference_atom_chains H --cutoff 2.0 --verbose

# Extract chains by distance from a reference small molecule hetatom chain in angstrom (5 Angstrom by default)
dock-prep --file_input path/to/1abc.pdb reference_hetatm_chains H --cutoff 2.0 --verbose
```

### Output Files 

The tool generates a series of progressively refined files that document each step in the protein preparation pipeline:

| File | Description | Purpose in Workflow |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| üìÑ`_structure_cleaned.pdb` | Initial cleaned structure | Removes HETATM records (waters, ligands, ions) and prepares the protein for structural completion |
| üìÑ`_structure_completed_final.pdb` | Structure with modeled residues | Fills in missing atoms and residues to create a complete protein model |
| üìÑ`_structure_flipped_h_final.pdb` | Optimized with hydrogens | Contains MolProbity-optimized hydrogen positions and corrected side-chain orientations |
| üìÑ`_structure_protonated.pqr` | Protonated structure | Includes atomic radii and charge parameters from PDB2PQR required for electrostatics |
| üìÑ`_structure_docking.pdbqt` | Final docking-ready file | **Primary output file** with all parameters needed for AutoDock Vina docking simulations |

> **Note**: The `docking.pdbqt` file is the primary output that should be used for docking simulations with AutoDock Vina. Intermediate files are preserved to allow inspection of each preparation step.

#### File Formats Explained

- **PDB**: Standard Protein Data Bank format containing atomic coordinates
- **PQR**: Modified PDB format that includes charge (Q) and radius (R) parameters
- **PDBQT**: Extended PDB format with partial charges (Q) and atom types (T) required by AutoDock Vina

For advanced users who want to customize the preparation process, these intermediate files can be modified before continuing to the next processing step using the `--input_file` parameter.

## Documentation

### Troubleshooting

#### Common MGLTools Issues

- **ImportError: No module named MolKit**: Ensure PYTHONPATH includes MGLToolsPckgs directory
- **No output file**: Check for error messages, verify input file exists, check write permissions

#### Dependency Issues
If you encounter errors related to missing dependencies, run the dependency checker:
```bash
dock-prep-check
```
This will help identify which tools or packages need to be installed or properly configured.

### Dependencies

This tool relies on:
- **MGLTools**: For PDB to PDBQT conversion
- **MolProbity (optional)**: For structure validation and hydrogen placement
- **OpenBabel**: For file format conversion (`obabel`)
- **PDB2PQR**: For protein protonation (`pdb2pqr30`)
